Week 6 - Full Stack Development

WHY WE ARE FOCUSING ON UNIT TEST MORE THAN ANY OTHER TYPES OF TESTING:
Unit testing offers numerous benefits in software development. It allows for the early detection of bugs by focusing on testing individual units or components of code in isolation, enabling developers to catch and address issues at an early stage. Moreover, unit tests promote better code quality by encouraging modular, loosely coupled, and maintainable code design. They serve as a form of documentation, providing insights into how individual units are expected to behave. Additionally, unit tests facilitate regression testing, ensuring that existing functionality remains intact during code changes. With their quick execution, unit tests provide fast feedback to developers, aiding in faster development cycles and easier issue isolation. Furthermore, unit tests play a crucial role in continuous integration and deployment pipelines, enabling automated testing and validation of code changes. While unit testing is invaluable, it should be part of a comprehensive testing strategy that includes other types of testing for thorough test coverage.
